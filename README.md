# FinancialManager
This application originated from a project at UNIP, and I didn't intend it to be a Financial Manager. It is ready to use, but in the future, I can create a database to store information.

It's easy to use. First, you need to download the compressed archive and simply start InterfaceUsuario.java in the src folder.
